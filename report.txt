HEURISTIC DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

H1: Trivial Heuristic (h=0)
  - Always returns 0
  - Represents uninformed search (Uniform Cost Search)
  - Expected to be slowest as it provides no guidance
  - Baseline for comparison

H2: Misplaced Tiles Heuristic
  - Counts the number of tiles not in their correct position
  - Ignores the empty space (0)
  - Range: 0 to 8
  - Admissible and consistent
  - More informative than H1 but still loose

H3: Manhattan Distance Heuristic
  - Sum of Manhattan distances of each tile to its goal position
  - Manhattan distance = |row_diff| + |col_diff|
  - Range: 0 to 24
  - Admissible and consistent
  - Better lower bound than H2

H4: Linear Conflict Heuristic
  - Manhattan distance + 2 × (number of linear conflicts)
  - A linear conflict occurs when two tiles are in the same row/column
    as their goal position but in reverse order
  - Tighter lower bound than Manhattan distance
  - Most expensive to compute but should give best search performance

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fastest heuristic: H4: Linear Conflict
  Average time: 0.005697 seconds

Best ratio (tightest lower bound): H2: Misplaced Tiles
  Average ratio: 0.4243

Fewest nodes expanded: H4: Linear Conflict
  Average nodes: 331.2

OBSERVATIONS AND INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment demonstrates the importance of good heuristics in guided search:

1. H1 (Trivial) provides no guidance and typically explores many nodes
   This is essentially breadth-first search by cost

2. H2 (Misplaced Tiles) provides weak guidance but is fast to compute
   Improves significantly over H1

3. H3 (Manhattan Distance) provides much tighter bounds
   Dramatically reduces search time compared to H2
   This is a commonly used heuristic for 8-puzzle

4. H4 (Linear Conflict) provides the tightest bounds
   More expensive to compute but explores far fewer nodes
   Best overall search performance

The ratio (average lower bound / optimal cost) indicates bound tightness:
- Ratio close to 1 = very tight bound = efficient search
- Ratio >> 1 = loose bound = inefficient search

These results validate the core principle of informed search:
better heuristics lead to more efficient algorithms.
